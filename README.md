# habits

This is a small [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/) project bootstrapped with `create-t3-app`.

## Goal

The goal is mostly just to showcase a small web application, and maybe make a youtube tutorial.

## What it looks like & How it works

It is a really simple app, so I'll just show you the following pictures:

## Packages I used

I used all of the packages in the T3 Stack, daisyUI, theme-change and AutoAnimate.
